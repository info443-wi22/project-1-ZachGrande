# INFO 443 Project -- Report on Imposter Syndrome Type Assessment Application

## Usage of Imposter Syndrome Type Assessment Application
This application can be utilized to identify an individual's imposter type with the **Interactive Quiz** and observe the **visualized results** to learn more about the cross sections between imposter types. Additionally, a user can gain insight from **real-world stories** of successful industry members as well as **tips** for how to combat feelings of imposter syndrome.

### Types of Imposter Syndrome (that can be revealed through quiz)
* The Perfectionist: Violet
* The Solosit: Dash
* The Expert: Elastagirl
* The Superhero: Mr. Incredible
* The Genius: Edna Mode

## Mission of Application
The goal of this application is to address feelings of imposter syndrome that women and minorities can experience in the tech field. To make the widely accepted variants of imposter syndrome seem less categorical, we have associated an Incredibles character with each archetype. 

This solution works specifically to address the United Nations 5th Sustainable Development Goal: Gender Equality. Imposter syndrome can limit the opportunites women and minorities are comfortable pursuing in their work environment. 

## Structure Diagram
We chose to break down the architecture of our codebase by analyzing the React Components. Additionally, we highlighted some React packages, such as Survey, which were highly utilized by our program.

## Process Flow Diagram
In our process flow, we highlighted both the client and backend sides, which are positioned on the left and right, respectively. This was documented with the intent of outlining both what the user experiences as well as the functionality.
